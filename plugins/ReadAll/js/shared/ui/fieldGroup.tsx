 * A text field or slider (or a few related ones) in a row, so it sits on the same background as the row
 * groups around it instead of floating on the page. Shared by every plugin; see

 *
 * `label` names the field (the row's label), `title` is an optional group heading, and the
 * explanation goes inside the row as muted text, so don't also pass `label` / `description` to the
 * TextInput. Error text stays on the TextInput (`status` + `errorMessage`).
 *
 * Not for search boxes above a list or fields inside an alert dialog: those stay bare.
 *
 * Call from inside a component's render: `revenge.*` is read here, so module scope is out
 * (docs/porting-rules.md rule 1).
